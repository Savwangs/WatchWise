- New device appears in parent's device list
- Device shows as "Online" initially
- Device details are correct

#### 3. Device Unlink Testing
**What to Test**:
- Tap unlink button on device card
- Confirm unlink action
- Verify device disappears from list
- Check notification is received

**Expected Results**:
- Confirmation dialog appears
- Device is removed from list after unlink
- Success notification is shown
- Child device shows as unpaired
