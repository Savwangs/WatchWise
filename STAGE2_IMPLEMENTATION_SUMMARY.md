    var isDisabled: Bool
    var dailyUsage: TimeInterval // in seconds
    let lastResetDate: Date
    let parentId: String
    
    // Computed properties for UI
    var formattedTimeLimit: String
    var formattedDailyUsage: String
    var usagePercentage: Double
}
```

### Bedtime Settings Model
```swift
struct BedtimeSettings {
    var isEnabled: Bool
    var startTime: String // "HH:mm" format
    var endTime: String // "HH:mm" format
    var enabledDays: [Int] // 1-7 for days of week
}
```

### New App Detection Model
```swift
struct NewAppDetection: Codable, Identifiable {
    let bundleId: String
    let appName: String
    let detectedAt: Date
    let parentId: String
    var isProcessed: Bool
}
```

### Key Features:

#### 2. App Bundle ID Mapping
- Comprehensive mapping of popular app bundle IDs to display names
- Support for 20+ popular apps (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- Fallback to bundle ID parsing for unknown apps

#### 3. Firebase Integration
- Real-time synchronization of restrictions across devices
- Persistent storage of all restriction settings
- Notification system for limit exceeded events
- Historical tracking of app usage and restrictions

#### 4. User Experience Features
- Intuitive slider interface for setting time limits
- Visual status indicators for app states
- Undo functionality for accidental deletions
- Quick action buttons for new app management

## üîÑ Data Flow

### App Usage Tracking Flow:
1. **DeviceActivityReport** ‚Üí Collects real-time app usage data
2. **ScreenTimeManager** ‚Üí Processes and caches the data
3. **AppRestrictionManager** ‚Üí Updates usage tracking and checks limits
4. **UI Components** ‚Üí Display real-time status and progress

### Restriction Application Flow:
1. **Parent sets restriction** ‚Üí AppRestrictionManager saves to Firebase
2. **Shared UserDefaults** ‚Üí Stores restriction data for child app access
3. **Child app reads restrictions** ‚Üí Applies limits and disables apps
4. **Real-time monitoring** ‚Üí Continuous enforcement and updates

### New App Detection Flow:
1. **DeviceActivityReport** ‚Üí Detects new app installations
2. **NewAppDetectionManager** ‚Üí Processes detections and sends notifications
3. **Parent receives notification** ‚Üí Can add to monitoring or ignore
4. **Restriction applied** ‚Üí New app gets default limits if added

- Advanced notification system
- App deletion detection and alerts
- Enhanced reporting and analytics

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **App limit setting** - Test slider functionality and limit enforcement
2. **Bedtime restrictions** - Verify automatic app disabling during bedtime
3. **New app detection** - Install new apps on child device and verify detection
4. **Real-time updates** - Monitor dashboard updates during active usage
5. **Cross-device sync** - Test restrictions on multiple parent devices

### Edge Cases:
- Apps with very short usage times
- Bedtime periods spanning midnight
- Network connectivity issues
- Large numbers of restricted apps
- Rapid app installation/deletion

## üìä Success Metrics

### User Engagement:
- Parent adoption of app restrictions
- Frequency of new app detection responses
- Bedtime restriction compliance
- Settings customization rates
