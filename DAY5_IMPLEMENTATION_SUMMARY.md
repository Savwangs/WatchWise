## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Simulator Testing**

#### **1. Basic Functionality Testing**
```bash
# 1. Launch the app in simulator
# 2. Create a child account
# 3. Navigate to child home view
# 4. Check permission request flow
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Permission request alert appears
- ✅ "Grant Permission" button works
- ✅ Authorization status shows "Authorized"
- ✅ Monitoring status shows "Active"

#### **2. Screen Time Data Collection**
```bash
# 1. Grant Family Controls permission
# 2. Use the "Sync Screen Time Data" debug button
# 3. Check console logs for data collection
# 4. Verify data appears in Firebase
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Console shows "Collecting screen time data for today..."
- ✅ App usage data is generated (simulated)
- ✅ Data is saved to Firebase
- ✅ No errors in console

#### **3. New App Detection**
```bash
# 1. Use the "Detect New Apps" debug button
# 2. Check console logs for detection process
# 3. Verify new apps are detected
# 4. Check Firebase for new app detections
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Console shows "Detecting new apps..."
- ✅ New apps are detected (simulated)
- ✅ Parent notifications are created
- ✅ Data appears in Firebase

#### **4. Real-time Updates**
```bash
# 1. Start monitoring
# 2. Use debug buttons to trigger updates
# 3. Check Firebase for real-time updates
# 4. Verify parent notifications
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Real-time data updates work
- ✅ Firebase documents are updated
- ✅ Parent notifications are sent
- ✅ No data loss

### **Physical Device Testing**

#### **1. Family Controls Authorization**
```bash
# 1. Install app on physical device
# 2. Request Family Controls permission
# 3. Go to Settings > Screen Time > Family Controls
# 4. Verify app appears in authorized apps
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Permission request works on device
- ✅ App appears in Family Controls settings
- ✅ Authorization persists across app restarts

#### **2. Real DeviceActivity Data**
```bash
# 1. Grant all permissions
# 2. Use various apps on the device
# 3. Wait for DeviceActivity intervals
# 4. Check for real app usage data
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Real app usage data is collected
- ✅ DeviceActivityReport extension processes data
- ✅ Real usage patterns appear in reports
- ✅ No simulated data when real data available

#### **3. New App Detection (Real)**
```bash
# 1. Install a new app on the device
# 2. Use the new app for a few minutes
# 3. Check for new app detection
# 4. Verify parent notification
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ New app is detected automatically
- ✅ Parent receives notification
- ✅ App appears in new app detections list
- ✅ Data is stored in Firebase

#### **4. Background Processing**
```bash
# 1. Start monitoring
# 2. Put app in background
# 3. Use other apps
# 4. Return to app and check data
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Background processing works
- ✅ Data is collected while app is backgrounded
- ✅ No data loss during background/foreground transitions

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Simulator Limitations**
- ❌ Family Controls authorization may not work properly in simulator
- ❌ DeviceActivityReport extension may not process real data
- ❌ Some features will fall back to simulated data
- ✅ All UI and logic can be tested
- ✅ Firebase integration works normally

### **Physical Device Requirements**
- ✅ iOS 15.0+ required for Family Controls
- ✅ Device must be signed in to iCloud
- ✅ Family Controls must be enabled in Settings
- ✅ App must be authorized in Family Controls

### **Production Considerations**
- ⚠️ DeviceActivityReport extension requires separate target in Xcode
- ⚠️ Extension must be properly configured in project settings
- ⚠️ App group entitlements must match between main app and extension
- ⚠️ Bundle identifiers must be properly configured

## 🔄 **Next Steps (Day 6)**

1. **DeviceActivityReport Extension Setup**
   - Configure extension target in Xcode project
   - Set up proper bundle identifiers
   - Configure app group sharing

2. **Real Data Integration**
   - Replace simulated data with real DeviceActivity data
   - Implement proper data aggregation
   - Add data validation and error handling

3. **Advanced Features**
   - App usage limits and restrictions
   - Bedtime enforcement
   - Detailed analytics and reporting
   - Parent dashboard improvements
