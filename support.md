## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started
**Q: How do I set up WatchWise for my family?**
A: Download WatchWise on both parent and child devices. Sign in with Apple, select your user type (Parent/Child), and follow the pairing process using the unique code.

**Q: How does device pairing work?**
A: The child device displays a unique 6-digit code. Enter this code on the parent device to establish a secure connection between devices.

### Screen Time Monitoring
**Q: How accurate is the screen time data?**
A: WatchWise uses Apple's official Family Controls framework to provide the same accurate data available in iOS Screen Time settings.

**Q: Can my child see what I'm monitoring?**
A: No, children can only see their own usage data and any messages you send them. They cannot see the detailed monitoring information.

### App Restrictions
**Q: How do I set app time limits?**
A: Go to Settings â†’ App Limits in the parent app. Select an app and set your desired time limit. The restriction will be enforced automatically.

**Q: What happens when a time limit is reached?**
A: The child will receive a notification and the app will be temporarily blocked until the next day or when you manually reset the limit.

### Privacy & Security
**Q: Is my family's data secure?**
A: Yes, WatchWise uses Apple's official frameworks and Firebase's secure infrastructure. We never access personal content like messages, photos, or browsing history.

**Q: Can I delete my family's data?**
A: Yes, you can request data deletion at any time by contacting support@watchwise.app.
